# Safe Newline Split

> PHP utility that safely splits text containing new lines across various environments (Linux, Windows, Mac)

In different run-time environments (Linux, Windows, Mac), a new line character is represented in different ways which makes it tricky to safely split a paragraph of text into an array where each item is one line of text.

This repository is created for testing purposes to ensure that different versions of PHP and environments pass the CI tests.
